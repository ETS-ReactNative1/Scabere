# Scabere

Scabere it's a mobile application to help you to manage your daily tasks. The front-end is in React-Native and Back-end in Node.js .

## Purpose

I did this project for school. We needed to do something in the end of the year and I choosed this.

## How to run

First you need to have your terminal in Scabere backend directory

`cd Scabere/backend`

To install all packeges needed you can use NPM or Yarn

**`yarn`**

After that you can start with:

**`yarn dev`**

> This comand is like this because I choosed so in [package.json](backend/package.json), you can change it if you want ;)
