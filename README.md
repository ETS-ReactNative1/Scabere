# Scabere

Scabere it's a mobile application to help you to manage your daily tasks. The front-end is in React-Native and Back-end in Node.js .

## Objective

I did this project for school. We needed to do something in the end of the year so I choosed this.

## How to run server

> To make this run correctly you need to have a cluster in mongodb and make a .env file with this line of code
> `DB_CONNECTION=YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING`

Have your terminal in this project

`cd Scabere/backend`

To install all packages needed you can use NPM or Yarn ( in this case I use yarn)

**`yarn`**

After that you can start with:

**`yarn dev`**

> This command is like this because I choosed so in [package.json](backend/package.json), you can change it if you want ;)
